# Experthub API Documentation

Through the different sections of the [documentation](/docs/connection/), we will attempt to demonstrate and explain the various ways to effectively work with the Experthub API.

We are pleased to provide this guide to ensure proper usage of the tool and improve efficiency when making any API-related inquiries.

For instance, the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) software allows us to make HTTP requests (``GET``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``, etc.) and receive different responses.
