# Sales flow rules

The sales flow rules are used to automatically modify or add products to the sale according to a series of conditions that are met depending on the selected products.

??? info "Examples"
    - If four units of the product 'Product1' are added to the sale, a fifth unit of the product is automatically added at zero cost.
    - If the product 'Product2' is added and the product 'Product3' is also added, a 50% discount will be applied to the product 'Product3'.
    - For every 20 children added to a school group, a free teacher ticket is added.

!!! tip "Important"
    The rules are not cumulative for the same product. If a rule has already been applied to a product, it is discarded for subsequent rules. The order of application of the rules is marked by the ``Order`` field of the ``Rules`` node.
